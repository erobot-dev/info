## I. Getting Started

In this project, we use flutter 2.5.3. If you have a different version, you should consider [installing FVM](https://soksereyphon8.medium.com/flutter-version-management-3c318c4ff97d).

### Prerequisites

```
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
### Built with

* [Flutter 2.5.3](https://flutter.dev) - The framework used
* [Dart](https://dart.dev/) - The language used
* [Erobot App API](https://github.com/erobot-dev/erobot_api) - By our backend team.

## II. Code generation 
### 1. Model generations with JSON Serialization
We use JSON Serializable [ https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/json#code-generation ] package build tool to generate a model from JSON to the Class object. In case you want to add more fields model or even change the model data type, you need to run the command:
```
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### 2. Assets generations with flutter_gen
We also use [flutter_gen](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_gen) which is the Flutter code generator for your assets, fonts, colors, … — to Get rid of all String-based APIs. To Generate new assets, run following commands:
```
fluttergen
```

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Assets.images.profile.image();
}
```

## III. State Management
We use [GetX](https://pub.dev/packages/get) for our state management solution with advantages of CLI. (We have not considered to use other solutions from GetX such as routing, snackbar & bottom sheet yet)

### 1. CLI
We use [get_cli](https://pub.dev/packages/get_cli) to automated our development process.
```
// To install:
flutter pub global activate get_cli

// To create a page:
// (Pages have controller, view, and binding)
// Note: you can use any name, ex: `get create page:login`
get create page:home

get install camera

// To install a dev package in your project (dependencies_dev):
get install flutter_launcher_icons --dev

// To remove a package from your project:
get remove http

// For more detail
get help
```
### 2. VSCode Exstension
We also use [GetX Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=get-snippets.get-snippets).

## IV. API Connection
Even we use getx, we don't use its `GetConnect` for communicating with our API.
### 1. To create an API:
For example, if we are creating a post API with the endpoint: https://example.com/posts.<br>
We have to create a class in `lib/services/apis/` folder, eg:
```dart
// - extends BaseResourceOwnerApi: if you need token in request header.
// - extends BaseAppApi: if you don't need token in request header.
class PostApi extends BaseResourceOwnerApi<PostModel> {
  Future<dynamic> fetchAllPosts() async {
    var queryParameters = {'included': 'images,author'}
    var result = await super.fetchAll(queryParameters: queryParameters);
    return result;
  }

  // https://example.com/posts 
  // => nameInUrl = posts
  @override
  String get nameInUrl => "posts";

  @override
  objectTransformer(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    return PostModel.fromJson(json);
  }

  ....
}
```
Check this file for more:
> [lib/services/apis/post_api.dart](lib/services/apis/post_api.dart)

### 2. Note
- Extends your class with [BaseResourceOwnerApi](lib/services/base_apis/base_resource_owner_api.dart), if you need token in request header.
- Extends your class with [BaseAppApi](lib/services/base_apis/base_app_api.dart), if you don't need token in request header.

## V. Dialogs, Snackbars, BottomSheets
### 1. Dialog
We use [adaptive_dialog](https://pub.dev/packages/adaptive_dialog) to display the dialog. Available dialogs are:
```
showOkAlertDialog()
showOkCancelAlertDialog()
showConfirmationDialog()
showModalActionSheet()
showTextInputDialog()
showTextAnswerDialog()
```

### TODO:
- [ ] Find Snackbars solotion
- [ ] Find BottomSheets solution
